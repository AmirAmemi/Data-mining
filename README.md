# 🔍 Data Mining

This repository contains various projects and algorithms focused on **data mining** techniques. The projects cover a variety of methods for discovering patterns, relationships, and trends in large datasets, and they include applications like classification, clustering, association rule mining, and anomaly detection.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

This repository includes implementations of different **data mining** algorithms and methodologies, such as:

- **Classification**: Techniques like decision trees, SVM, and k-NN for classifying data into predefined categories.
- **Clustering**: Algorithms like k-means and DBSCAN for grouping similar data points together.
- **Association Rule Mining**: Discovering interesting relationships between variables in large datasets.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying unusual or outlier data points in datasets.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Techniques like PCA for reducing the number of features while preserving important information.

Each project provides a practical demonstration of how these data mining techniques can be applied to real-world datasets.
